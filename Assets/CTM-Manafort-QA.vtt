two republican congressmen and a prominent donor trump

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.260
denied any trouble yesterday in florida.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.250
So, I just wanted-to tell you the campaign is doing really well it's never been.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.240
So well united as we started on june I would say right

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.060
now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been since we

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.550
began where doing incredibly well....

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.390
Paul manafort chairman the trump campaign Paul morning this is interesting and newt gingrich said

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.580
if he has more week like this is going to be too far gone in order to catch up then

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.030
weather he wouldn't vote for clinton karl rove said that is he has more weeks like this as 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.220
I said there's a range of friendly bar taking place at this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.500
time that suggest that it may be slipping time is of the estimate and more

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.330
week like this they make it impossible to catch up well that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.080
thats not true there's plenty of time were in the first week of august usually

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.420
campaign in historical terms don't even start till september we are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.420
use august as a very aggressive month mr trump yesterday was in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.910
florida crowds of fifteen thousand people those are october crowds 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.760
we announced our fifty state directors this week everybody's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.150
deployed an working we raised the record amount money the eighty million dollars

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.390
with no bills so this is all cash cash on hand so, no, we're feeling comfortable

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.080
we're...comfortable what we are concerned comfortable where we are organizationally

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.770
we're not comfortable with is the narrative that the media seems to be taking which is which is building

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.560
a storyline of that the democrats are controlling the race the word feel

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.640
comfortable if you look at our messages this is going to be about change

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.010
...and all the polls even the one...talk about change you're talking about a, 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.160
you know, the khan family whole range of things they're not change and not

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.000
about issues well we were talking about changes yesterday we will be for the rest of this week

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.080
next week we'll be talking about economic plan you know, the khan family situation that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.970
mr trump was trying to talk about the fact that they were caught up in something bigger than them yet yes

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.890
sorry about loss of thier son as we all are but what he was trying

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.710
to talk about was the issue with the war the...the rise

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.060
you agree this has been a very bad week for the trump campaign and how

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.220
did how are you guys able to ignore the dropping poll numbers

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.060
and the defection that are happening dropping poll numbers were expected...the democratic of

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.160
...expect...this big of drop depends on which poll you look and you know,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.860
we feel like in another week or so polls are going to even out we always thought that we had a bounce we knew

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.060
that democrats had bounce and, in you see in the situation looks like an

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.770
uneven field but in two weeks we think that's going to even out and out there on a message which we will

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.190
be the framework of this election favors donald trump if we run the campaign that we're

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.680
planning on running...we think we're going to win we don't plan on

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.550
winning in august we plan on awaited november...in that will become evident in campaign

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.600
deploys there's a lot going on the local levels that you're not seeing that he doesn't seem to appear to stay on 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.540
message though isn't an issue for you

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.400
well he the thing is he's new admit picked what he says...

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.240
impede like the other day...get talking about strong message on what's going on with this four hundred

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.340
hundred-million-dollars...the...which is an outragous amount of money that was

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120
paid for hostages that probably went right straight to the terrorists

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.230
was cash...gave four hundred billion dollars in cash to the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.360
iranians the harbor of terrorism you can only imagine with that money went in

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.560
...in that same rally where he got on-message 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.350
hitting the obama administration on that point he also went off message an rehash

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.290
all controversies including the of split with

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.320
fox news host meagan kelly...he went back to talking about the blood coming out of her 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.560
whatever 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.470
was it helpful do you think from yesterday to clarify which part of her body he meant when he said that

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.410
is a responsibility on both parts the media and the campaign and everybody understood

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.950
what the real messages were and that speech and was talking about the iranian situation about the cash

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.760
to decisions ... you watch that...the headline was going to be on the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.660
four hundred-million on that attack why do you have to go there why do you have to go on these issues and rehash

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.200
old controversy we feel confident that the issues are being heard on

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.890
the local levels we had are still not getting report at the national level because also local media coverage to

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.510
let ask about mr trump not endorsing paul ryan 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.450
this is the front-page of the many of the paper today and then his vice-presidential running

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.190
mate disagreeing with him and thing I strongly support paul ryan

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.430
let me ask you your a republican a lifelong republican loyal one

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.260
do you support speaker ryan re-election I'm chairman of the campaign

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.270
is chairman of the campaign we have campaign position not getting involved in primaries

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.080
paul ryan is a close personal friend of mike pence paul ryan nominated...governor

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.860
pence republican convention provides president donald trump understood that relationship

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.700
...of course, you know, your life-long republican

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.120
mean you served for president in the past for years...you support paul ryan

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.280
support as a speaker and I know after support for candidate for president to

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.470
...really ? 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.060
Back...talking to the...

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.430
The election and paul ryan jumping...and that

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.160
What will it take for him to endorse paul ryan...

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.330
...he's going to support paul ryan...he does support paul ryan he said he's going to work with paul ryan

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.880
there's no issue about that he didn't take a position in the primaries

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.600
...but...a position many primaries thats not the news...the

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.960
two working together to elect republican congress and president and I think you

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.380
you're going see that can i ask you this question in terms of your previous

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.370
role I spent a fair amount of time as a reporter with

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.950
putin in terms of an interview maybe five hours...together he constantly 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.960
said to me cia and others were responsible for the overthrow of...

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.890
...which in ukraine in do you believe he is right on that...which

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.190
wrong conversation eh I think that the

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.100
imagination of ukraine a deal with a lot of geopolitics america wasn't

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.810
involved in say they I think the people over threw 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.730
but there's a lot more going out in that country?

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.570
I don't think that which was the sole one person that you can say

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.380
and if you look at what went up...in moscow,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.730
was not a good place situation in ukraine is the geopolitics

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.410
are very interesting that you look at but ukraine is in europe today

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.970
in europe today because...agreement that was negotiated primarily

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.890
by article which and frankly that I was the principle person looking to do

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.540
right conversation for another time thank you paul I think we should get back to your thing that donald

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.230
 endored paul ryan for president I think that is very interesting

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.070
not yet prepared to do it...rule it out correct which then

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.700
...paul ryan

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.940
To get in trouble

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.670
...like having at the table thank you very much for coming in today.
