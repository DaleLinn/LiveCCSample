00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.240
Time Now for morning rounds with CBS News chief medical correspondent doctor john look and news contributor doctor 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.200
terra first up a statement of caution for patients with heart failure the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.920
american heart association warn that many commonly used medications could

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.450
cause or worsen heart failure for those with the condition

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.230
what kind of medications we talking about this is such a statement anthony both for doctors

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.730
and patients living with heart failure this statement 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.030
outlined the prescription medication and over-the-counter medication and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.280
complementary herbal or supplement medications that might exacerbate heart failure this

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.670
very vulnerable group of patients they live in a delicate balance between being

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.650
compensated and stable and suddenly having the balance tip to the point where they're d complicated and they end up

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.430
in the hospital so they are on multiple medications many of them up to seven prescription med

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.710
multiple providers they have lots of other medical condition that

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.150
really wonderful that we have this guide out there now and some of these medications

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.580
they exacerbate heart failure in different ways some of them do by actually affecting the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.050
mile cardiol cells toxic to them some of them cause retention of sodium 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.000
which increases fluid retention others affect how well the heartbeat or contract another

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.770
one simply affect the ability of the patient own heart failure medications

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.120
to work effectively what really caught my ear that herbal supplement and over-the-counter

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.170
are all trained to think these are okay...like...I spoke to doctor robert page

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
the lead author of this statement and he the clinical pharmacology

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.400
the university of colorado school of poverty and he really emphasized how

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.860
important is to realize that these substances are pharmacological the active so,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.890
for example, he pointed out that antacid have sodium and I 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.930
went this morning and I looked at, you know, you have to really look...how much sodium is

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.620
in there and I'm sure they differ one to the other there's ibuprofen and things like that these

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.240
that can cause fluid retention in cold medicines and other kinds of medicine and then

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.230
there are decongestants, decongestants likes to the bed and they are part of cold medicines

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.340
and they can have cause problems but the hard so you really...drug urban direction anything

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.860
that's pharmacologically active can cause a problem even if it's supposedly

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340
urban so I tell my patients brown bag it,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.080
throw everything in there let me take a look at exactly what you are you taking the drug...the patient

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.020
wanting to bring it up so you really have to make sure to look for those terra as you point out 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.940
in the heart failure patient can be taking up to seven different medication

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.640
you keep track of all this stuff right most important I not only tell my heart patient

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.500
but all patient that they should keep a list on them at all times of the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.890
the medication the frequency they should understand why they're taking what they're taking

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.860
an any changes to their medications that are being made either med stopping or starting

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.000
they should call the doctor managing heart failure and they can say can I stop can I start

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.810
that it's helpful to have with the statement called the captain of your medication

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.550
somebody can really oversee everything you're taking and we need to tell patients to get the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.910
habit of checking the label that john said not just for a fault in our sodium and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.440
cans of soup but also on our medication labeled as well, you know,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.030
I think a lot of things we can do at

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.030
to hopefully...and the doctors have to really these days

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.100
be using a computer these drug-drug interactions you cannot keep track of them

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.130
that and brown bag is a really good piece of advice...and...all right moving on

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.090
history diagnosis mary todd lincoln had a lot of tragedy and trauma in her life she

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.070
lost to young children of course

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.980
next to her husband the president when he was assassinated in eighteen sixty

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.340
five all that contributed to years and depression but now a medical expert 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.610
believe a physical cause for mental struggle john has more on that.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.630
History has not been kind to mary todd lincoln wife 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.730
of our sixteenth president she would attempt to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.900
...unpredictable force

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.300
eventually her son had her commited madame president

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.190

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.350
...when have I been bam boozled

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.020
This white area here is not her dress its her skin but doctor john photos

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.280
physician and medical historian that famously fiery first lady

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.710
was not only misunderstood but misdiagnosed photos

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.600
...a new theory about mary todd lincoln and erratic

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.980
behavior was caused by a condition called per...that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.930
impairs the body's ability to absorb vitamin btwelve from food efficiently

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.700
...the person becomes btwelve the patient eventually and that causes

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.840
lots of problems and almost every organ in the body ultimately...fatal illness until treatment

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.650
with discovered decade after her death disease can lead to many

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.080
symptoms exhibited by mary todd lincoln sore mouth
 
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.000
pale skin difficulty walking and psychiatric problems

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.180
it can also cause swelling the puffy ness it is not in a way that would occur

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.600
with just accumulation of fat today the disease can be picked up on a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.570
simple blood test and easily treated with btwelve supplement she had a

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.030
sick brain and was doing the best she could in a very complicated

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.390
demanding environment and I think to have done as well as she did with the

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.190
kind of handicaps that she had I think that deserves our admiration, you know,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.920
I do have some patients not that common who have pernicious anemia before I tell the...I have to

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.780
tell them look I'm about to use a word as

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.590
Oddly harmful we could...prodigious...not...anymore you're easily treated

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.880
not fatal you give btwelve supplementation so it it's out there

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.180
and it's amazing to look back in history and see something like that but not so pernicious afterall

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.610
we should say something that he's making a diagnosis, 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.900
you know, a hard enough to make a diagnosis in present an to make a hundred-years ago

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.640
thank you both very much.
